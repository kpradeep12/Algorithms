```
class AdjacencyMatrix {
    ArrayList<List<Integer>> nodes = new ArrayList<>();
    boolean isDirected;
}
```

## Problems

### 1. Breadth First Search Traversal
```

```

### 2 Depth First Search - Iterative

### 3 Depth First Search - Recursive

### 4 Balanced Binary Tree
Writh a method to see if a Binary tree is 'superbalanced'

> A tree is superbalanced, if the differences between the depths of any two leaf nodes is no greater than one.
